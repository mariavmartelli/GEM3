      <p class="imgPageDescription">The goal of this study is to compare the results of 3D real-life non-local computations on nanocubes with available experimental results. We were able to show blueshifts on the gap-plasmon resonances, and to associate them with certainty to non-local effects. To provide highly-accurate results, we extended the use of curvilinear meshes to the discretization of the hydrodynamic model. The extension of the method is described in the paper mentioned afterwards, while the comparison with experimental data will be described in an upcoming publication.</p>
